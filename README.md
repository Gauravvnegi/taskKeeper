#Project Aim-
The project focuses on robust user authentication mechanisms to ensure only authorized users can access its features.
– Utilizes Angular's HttpClient module effectively to facilitate communication with the backend API for user authentication and
comprehensive task management.
– It offers a comprehensive set of task-keeping functionalities, including task creation, editing, deletion, and restoration.
– Tasks can be marked as important, providing users with a prioritization option and enabling them to search tasks based on priority
– Leverages BehaviorSubject and Observable from RxJS to efficiently manage and update task data, ensuring real-time
responsiveness for users.
